# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  students = Student.create([{ first_name: 'Chicago', last_name: 'Louis' }, { first_name: 'Copenhagen', last_name: 'Louis'}])
